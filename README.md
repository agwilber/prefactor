## The LOFAR pre-facet calibration pipeline.

Parsets for the genericpipeline that do the first calibration of LOFAR data. Originally in order 
to prepare said data for the Factor facet calibration (https://github.com/lofar-astron/factor), but 
also useful if you don't plan to run Factor.

It includes:
* clock-TEC separation with transfer of clock from the calibrator to the target
* some flagging and averaging of amplitude solutions
* diagnostic plots
* at least some documentation

The version 2.0 development branch includes:
* grouping of subbands by actual frequency instead of file number
* applying Ionospheric RM corrections

It does not (yet?) include:
* speed and disk usage improvements by optimized usage of NDPPP
* wide-band cleaning in Initial-Subtract (see deepimage branch)

There is a wiki page with more or less useful hints: http://www.lofar.org/wiki/doku.php?id=public:user_software:prefactor

There are several pipeline parsets in this repository:
* Pre-Facet-Calibrator.parset : The calibrator part of the "standard" pre-facet calibration pipeline. 
* Pre-Facet-Target.parset : The target part of the "standard" pre-facet calibration pipeline. 
* Pre-Facet-Cal.parset : The "standard" pipeline, calling first the calibrator and then the target pipelines.
* Initial-Subtract.parset : A pipeline that generates full FoV images and subtracts the sky-models from the visibilities. (Needed for facet-calibration, this could also be done as the first step of Factor.)

Outdated and thus deprecated are:
* Pre-Facet-Cal-RawData-Single.parset : A pre-facet pipeline to work on raw (non NDPPP'ed) data
* Pre-Facet-Cal-RawData-PreAvg.parset : A pre-facet pipeline to work on raw (non NDPPP'ed) data that does the subband concatenating in the first NDPPP step. (To reduce the number of files on systems where this is a problem, e.g. JURECA)

Software requirements:
* the full "offline" LOFAR software installation version >= 2.17
* LoSoTo (version >=0.3 -- see https://github.com/revoltek/losoto)
* LSMTool (see https://github.com/darafferty/LSMTool)
* Python-PP (see http://www.parallelpython.com/ or https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pp )
* RMextract (see https://github.com/maaijke/RMextract)
* Python matplotlib
* WSClean (for Initial-Subtract, version >=1.12 -- see https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsclean/)
* APLpy (for Initial-Subtract)

With special thanks to Stefan Froehlich <s.froehlich somewhere fz-juelich.de> for developing the 
genericpipeline.
